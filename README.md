**TO:** Prospective Adopters & Evaluation Committee  
**FROM:** System Architecture Review Board  
**DATE:** September 7, 2025  
**SUBJECT:** Proposal for Adoption of the NEXUS Enables eXecutive User Systems (NEXUS) Deca-System Framework, Bioelectric Revision 


## 1.0 Executive Summary

### 1.1 Introduction and Operational Need
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the NEXUS Enables eXecutive User Systems (NEXUS), an architecture framework designed to enhance human performance, resilience, and mission effectiveness. In an operational environment characterized by high volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), conventional, ad-hoc approaches to personal management are insufficient. The NEXUS is proposed as a standardized, interoperable framework to replace these disjointed methods with a coherent system.

This revision integrates a critical paradigm shift in the life sciences: the understanding of **bioelectricity** as the fundamental medium for information processing, computation, and communication in all living tissues, not just the nervous system.[1, 2] The human organism is not merely a mechanical system with a computational brain; it is an integrated, multi-scale bioelectric system.[3] This framework reframes the operator as a complex, goal-seeking servomechanism whose performance is a direct function of the coherence of their internal bioelectric field.

### 1.2 Architectural Approach
The NEXUS is a modular, layered architecture integrating ten core subsystems across four primary domains: **Bioelectric, Physiological, Strategic,** and **Executional**. This structure ensures that foundational bioelectric potential supports higher-order physiological and cognitive functions, creating a robust and resilient operational posture.

*   **Capability Viewpoint (CV):** The NEXUS delivers a suite of critical capabilities currently lacking a unified development path. These include, but are not limited to: advanced physiological state regulation, coherent internal motivation, accelerated skill acquisition, high-velocity decision-making, and frictionless task management. Each subsystem within the architecture directly maps to one or more of these mission-essential capabilities by modulating the operator's bioelectric state.
*   **Operational Viewpoint (OV):** The framework defines a clear operational flow. It begins with managing the operator's cellular energy and baseline bioelectric charge (**Bio-System**), proceeds to regulate the coherence of the organism-wide bioelectric field (**Polyvagal Theory**), aligns internal psychological resources by encoding a target bioelectric state (**IFS, Valuation Theory, Psycho-Cybernetics**), orients the operator within the strategic landscape (**Systems Thinking**), and culminates in decisive, effective action (**OODA, GTD, NVC**), all while continuously improving via an integrated feedback mechanism (**Deliberate Practice**).
*   **Systems Viewpoint (SV):** The ten subsystems are designed for maximum interoperability, as they all operate upon and are influenced by the same underlying bioelectric medium. For example, the output of the **Valuation Theory** subsystem (defined values) provides the target bioelectric pattern for the **Psycho-Cybernetics** subsystem (goal-setting). The physiological state data from the **Polyvagal** subsystem - a direct readout of the bioelectric field's coherence - informs the **OODA** loop's Orient phase. This high degree of integration eliminates internal conflict (bioelectric decoherence) and creates synergistic performance gains.

### 1.4 Recommendation
The NEXUS provides a coherent, teachable, and scalable architecture for human capital development grounded in biophysical principles. Adoption of this framework is recommended to establish a common language and methodology for enhancing operator effectiveness across all domains. It represents a shift from viewing personal development as a series of disconnected tactics to managing it as the integrated, bioelectric, mission-critical system it is.

## 2.0 Subsystem Analysis

### 2.1 Bio-System
*   **2.1.1 Operational Definition:** The **Bio-System** is the foundational architecture layer responsible for maintaining and charging the operator's core bioelectric potential. It governs the core processes of **sleep, nutrition,** and **exercise**, which are the primary mechanisms for optimizing mitochondrial function and restoring the voltage potential across every cell membrane. Its primary function is to ensure the biological hardware has sufficient charge to power all other computational and physiological systems.[4, 5]
*   **2.1.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Outputs to Polyvagal Theory:** Provides the baseline bioelectric charge. A well-charged **Bio-System** (e.g., adequate sleep, stable blood sugar) is a prerequisite for achieving and sustaining a coherent Ventral Vagal (safe/social) bioelectric state.[6, 7]
    *   **Outputs to GTD:** Directly dictates the available bioelectric energy for task execution. The operator's capacity to complete tasks is a direct function of their cellular energy levels.[8]
    *   **Receives Inputs from GTD:** Scheduled tasks such as workouts, meal prep, and sleep routines are managed within the **GTD** system, creating a command-and-control feedback loop for planned recharging.
*   **2.1.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem is the prime contributor to the **Sustained Peak Performance** and **Physical Readiness** capabilities. It ensures the operator has the metabolic and bioelectric stability to withstand prolonged stress and maintain high cognitive function without degradation.
*   **2.1.4 Implementation Note:** Initial implementation should focus on establishing non-negotiable baseline metrics for sleep duration/quality, nutritional intake, and physical activity protocols. These parameters should be treated as mission-critical logistics for maintaining cellular voltage, not as optional wellness activities.
*   **2.1.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Nutrition):** An operator follows a pre-mission nutritional protocol focused on low-glycemic foods, high-quality proteins, and healthy fats to ensure stable blood sugar and sustained energy, preventing the performance degradation associated with metabolic fluctuations.[9, 10]
    *   **Example 2 (Sleep):** An operator adheres to a strict sleep hygiene protocol, ensuring 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night, particularly in the days leading up to a high-stress operation. This is treated as a critical recharging cycle for cellular batteries, essential for cognitive function and emotional regulation.[6, 11]
    *   **Example 3 (Exercise):** An operator engages in a mixed-modality exercise regimen (aerobic and resistance training) designed to increase mitochondrial density and efficiency, thereby enhancing the body's overall capacity to produce and utilize energy under load.

### 2.2 Polyvagal Theory
*   **2.2.1 Operational Definition:** The **Polyvagal** subsystem is the master regulator of the organism's overall bioelectric field. It functions as an internal state-management system, interpreting cues of safety or danger ("neuroception") to shift the operator between three primary bioelectric configurations: a coherent, high-complexity state of safety (Ventral Vagal); a mobilized, simplified state of fight-or-flight (Sympathetic); or a low-energy, shutdown state (Dorsal Vagal).
*   **2.2.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Receives Inputs from Bio-System:** Its state is heavily influenced by the body's baseline charge; fatigue or poor nutrition can trigger a threat-response state independent of external cues.[9]
    *   **Outputs to IFS:** A coherent Ventral Vagal state is the required operating condition for accessing the leadership-focused **Self**. Threat-response states correspond to and trigger the activation of protective, decoherent bioelectric sub-patterns ("parts").
    *   **Outputs to OODA Loop:** The operator's bioelectric field state directly informs and biases the **Orient** phase, either enabling open, creative analysis (Ventral Vagal) or narrowing focus to threat perception (Sympathetic).[12]
*   **2.2.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem delivers the **Advanced Physiological State Regulation** and **Stress Resilience** capabilities. Mastery allows the operator to consciously shift the body's bioelectric field from a decoherent threat response to a state of coherent focus, even under duress.[13]
*   **2.2.4 Implementation Note:** Implementation involves training the operator to first recognize the physiological signatures of each state (e.g., via Heart Rate Variability monitoring) and then to utilize specific techniques (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing) to consciously shift states as the situation requires.
*   **2.2.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Down-Regulation):** After a sudden, high-stress event (e.g., a simulated ambush), an operator consciously employs a 4x4 box breathing technique for 90 seconds to actively shift from a Sympathetic (fight-or-flight) state back to a Ventral Vagal (calm, focused) state, restoring cognitive clarity.
    *   **Example 2 (State Awareness):** An operator uses a wearable device to monitor their Heart Rate Variability (HRV) throughout the day. By correlating low HRV readings with specific events or internal thoughts, they develop a heightened awareness of their triggers for entering a Sympathetic state, allowing for proactive regulation.
    *   **Example 3 (Co-Regulation):** A team leader notices a subordinate is visibly distressed (displaying physiological signs of a Sympathetic state). The leader intentionally adopts a calm vocal tone and open body language (Ventral Vagal cues) to help the subordinate's nervous system co-regulate and return to a state of psychological safety.

### 2.3 Valuation Theory
*   **2.3.1 Operational Definition:** The **Valuation Theory** subsystem is the strategic architecture for defining purpose and motivation. It is the formal process by which the operator consciously defines a set of core principles that encode the "target bioelectric state" for the organism's goal-striving servomechanism. This provides a stable, top-down reference pattern against which the current state can be compared.
*   **2.3.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Outputs to IFS:** Provides the core mission parameters for the **Self** to lead the internal system toward, helping align conflicting bioelectric patterns ("parts") under a shared purpose.
    *   **Outputs to Psycho-Cybernetics:** Supplies the definitive "target data" for programming the servomechanism, ensuring the goal is encoded as a desirable and motivating bioelectric state.[14]
    *   **Outputs to OODA Loop:** Acts as the primary ethical and strategic filter during the **Orient** phase, ensuring decisions are aligned with the target bioelectric state.
*   **2.3.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem delivers the **Coherent Mission & Purpose Orientation** capability. It ensures the operator's actions are guided by a stable, internal reference pattern, providing resilience against mission creep and morale degradation.
*   **2.3.4 Implementation Note:** Implementation is achieved through structured written exercises to identify and articulate a hierarchy of personal and professional values. This "Values & Mission Directive" should be formalized and reviewed periodically.
*   **2.3.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Clarification Exercise):** An operator completes a formal "Values Clarification" exercise, identifying and ranking their top five core values (e.g., Integrity, Service, Mastery, Teamwork, Courage). They write a one-paragraph definition for what each value means in practice.
    *   **Example 2 (Decision Filter):** Faced with two viable but ethically distinct courses of action, an operator explicitly reviews their written Values Directive. They choose the option that aligns most closely with their highest-ranked value of "Integrity," even though it is the more difficult path.
    *   **Example 3 (Mission Alignment):** Before deploying, a team leader facilitates a session where the team collectively defines its core operational values. This shared directive is used to align individual actions and resolve internal team conflicts throughout the mission.

### 2.4 Internal Family Systems (IFS)
*   **2.4.1 Operational Definition:** The **IFS** subsystem is the command and control framework for managing the operator's internal bioelectric landscape. It models the mind as a collection of "parts" - distinct bioelectric sub-patterns with specific roles - coordinated by a core "Self," which represents a state of maximal bioelectric coherence and integration. The system's function is to resolve internal decoherence by aligning these parts.
*   **2.4.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Receives Inputs from Polyvagal Theory:** The activation of protective "parts" is directly correlated with the prevailing physiological threat response (Sympathetic or Dorsal Vagal states).
    *   **Outputs to NVC:** The coherent, compassionate state of the **Self** is the ideal internal state from which to deploy the **NVC** protocol for effective interpersonal bioelectric co-regulation.
*   **2.4.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem delivers the **Internal Coherence & Psychological Integration** capability. It reduces internal bioelectric conflict and allows the operator to act with a sense of unified purpose.
*   **2.4.4 Implementation Note:** Implementation requires a structured practice of internal dialogue, where the operator learns to identify which "part" is active, listen to its concerns from the coherent perspective of the **Self**, and provide leadership rather than suppression.
*   **2.4.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Managing Procrastination):** An operator notices a strong urge to procrastinate on a critical report. Instead of forcing the work, they take a moment to internally ask the "procrastinating part" what it is afraid of. The part reveals a fear of failure. From the calm perspective of "Self," the operator reassures the part that its contribution is valued regardless of the outcome, reducing the internal resistance.
    *   **Example 2 (Pre-Briefing Centering):** Before a high-stakes briefing, a leader recognizes an anxious, critical "part" is active. The leader visualizes stepping back, allowing their calm, confident "Self" to take the lead, and then internally thanks the anxious part for trying to protect them, asking it to trust the Self's competence.
    *   **Example 3 (Resolving Internal Conflict):** An operator feels conflicted between a "part" that wants to train harder and a "part" that is exhausted and wants to rest. From Self, they facilitate an internal negotiation, acknowledging the needs of both parts and agreeing on a compromise: a shorter, high-intensity workout followed by a dedicated recovery session.

### 2.5 Psycho-Cybernetics
*   **2.5.1 Operational Definition:** The **Psycho-Cybernetics** subsystem is the programming interface for the subconscious mind, modeled as a goal-striving bioelectric servomechanism. It operates by setting a clear, emotionally resonant target - a desired bioelectric pattern - and allows the subconscious to automatically regulate micro-behaviors to minimize the error between the current state and the target state.
*   **2.5.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Receives Inputs from Valuation Theory:** This ensures the programmed goals are meaningful and encoded as a motivating bioelectric state.[14]
    *   **Outputs to OODA Loop:** Provides a pre-computed "success pattern" that informs and accelerates the **Decide** phase by creating a bioelectric template for action.[15]
*   **2.5.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem provides the **Automated Goal-Striving & Enhanced Confidence** capabilities. It reduces the need for constant conscious effort by offloading goal-oriented behavior to the highly efficient subconscious bioelectric network.
*   **2.5.4 Implementation Note:** Primary implementation is through consistent, multi-sensory mental rehearsal (visualization) of successful outcomes. This practice activates the same neural networks as physical action, effectively pre-loading the target bioelectric pattern into the system.[15]
*   **2.5.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Skill Acquisition):** A pilot mentally rehearses a complex flight maneuver in a simulator, visualizing not just the physical movements but also the instrument readings and the feeling of a successful execution. This primes the neural pathways for the actual flight.[15]
    *   **Example 2 (Confidence Building):** A junior officer preparing for their first command mentally rehearses handling various challenging leadership scenarios. They visualize themselves acting decisively, communicating clearly, and earning the respect of their team, thereby building a self-image consistent with success.
    *   **Example 3 (State Rehearsal):** An operator visualizes themselves remaining calm and focused while disarming a simulated explosive device. They focus on the physiological sensations of a Ventral Vagal state (slow heart rate, steady hands), programming this state as the desired response to a high-stress trigger.[16]

### 2.6 Systems Thinking
*   **2.6.1 Operational Definition:** The **Systems Thinking** subsystem is the primary strategic analysis tool for consciously modeling complex environments. It is the deliberate, analytical attempt to map the feedback loops and interconnections that the body's integrated bioelectric network processes automatically, non-consciously, and in parallel to generate intuition.
*   **2.6.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Outputs to OODA Loop:** Provides a detailed, dynamic "map" of the operational environment that vastly improves the quality and accuracy of the **Orient** phase.
    *   **Outputs to Deliberate Practice:** Identifies the key skills (leverage points) that, if encoded as stable bioelectric patterns, will have the greatest impact on performance.
*   **2.6.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem delivers **Advanced Situational Awareness & Strategic Acumen**. It allows the operator to consciously understand the underlying structure of a problem, complementing the intuitive, holistic understanding provided by the bioelectric system.
*   **2.6.4 Implementation Note:** Implementation involves training the operator to visually map systems, identify feedback loops, and consistently ask "And then what?" to trace the potential effects of actions.
*   **2.6.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Logistics Analysis):** Instead of addressing recurring supply shortages one at a time (linear thinking), a logistics officer maps the entire supply chain as a system, identifying a critical delay in the procurement process (a leverage point) that is causing a cascading effect of shortages downstream.
    *   **Example 2 (Team Dynamics):** A team leader observes that team morale is low. Instead of blaming individuals, they map the system of interactions and discover a reinforcing feedback loop: missed deadlines lead to increased pressure from leadership, which causes stress and reduces performance, leading to more missed deadlines.
    *   **Example 3 (Strategic Planning):** In a wargaming exercise, an officer analyzes the adversary not just as a collection of units, but as a complex system with political, economic, and social components. This allows them to identify a non-military intervention (e.g., information operations) as the highest-leverage point to achieve their objective.

### 2.7 OODA Loop
*   **2.7.1 Operational Definition:** The **OODA Loop** is the central, real-time cognitive processing engine for tactical execution. It is an iterative cycle of **Observing** the environment, **Orienting** based on all available internal and external data, **Deciding** on a course of action, and **Acting** to enable rapid adaptation.
*   **2.7.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Integrates All Systems:** The **Orient** phase is the primary integration hub, synthesizing data from the operator's bioelectric field state (**Polyvagal**), target bioelectric state (**Valuation, P-C**), and environmental map (**Systems Thinking**).
    *   **Outputs to GTD & NVC:** The **Act** phase generates the discrete tasks captured by **GTD** or the interpersonal engagements executed using **NVC**.
    *   **Outputs to Deliberate Practice:** The results of each action provide the critical performance feedback necessary for refining bioelectric skill patterns.
*   **2.7.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem is the source of the **High-Velocity Adaptive Decision-Making** capability. The quality of this capability is constrained by the coherence of the underlying bioelectric field; a threat state (Sympathetic) degrades the Orient phase and slows the loop.[17, 18]
*   **2.7.4 Implementation Note:** Mastery is achieved not by speed alone, but by developing a richer **Orientation** phase, which is the engine of the entire process. This requires maintaining a coherent (Ventral Vagal) bioelectric state.
*   **2.7.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Air Combat):** A fighter pilot **Observes** an enemy aircraft maneuvering. They **Orient** based on their training, the enemy's likely intent, their own aircraft's capabilities, and their physiological state. They **Decide** on a specific counter-maneuver and **Act** by executing it, immediately beginning a new loop by observing the enemy's reaction.
    *   **Example 2 (Emergency Response):** A paramedic arrives at a chaotic accident scene. They **Observe** multiple casualties and hazards. They **Orient** using triage protocols and their assessment of the most critical injuries. They **Decide** to apply a tourniquet to the most severely bleeding victim first and **Act**, then immediately re-observe the scene to prioritize the next action.
    *   **Example 3 (Business Negotiation):** A negotiator **Observes** a subtle shift in the other party's body language. They **Orient** by considering this new data in the context of the negotiation's history and their own goals. They **Decide** to change their line of questioning and **Act** by asking a probing question to explore the observed shift.

### 2.8 Deliberate Practice
*   **2.8.1 Operational Definition:** The **Deliberate Practice** subsystem is the architecture's dedicated performance improvement engine. It is a highly structured methodology for encoding new skills as stable, efficient bioelectric patterns through targeted effort, immediate feedback, and repetition.
*   **2.8.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Receives Inputs from Systems Thinking:** Identifies which skills are the highest-leverage targets for improvement.
    *   **Receives Inputs from OODA Loop:** The outcome of the **Act** phase provides the critical performance feedback for the practice cycle.
    *   **Outputs to All Other Systems:** The improvements gained through practice upgrade the performance of every other subsystem by creating more efficient and robust bioelectric circuits for specific tasks.
*   **2.8.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem directly provides the **Accelerated Skill Acquisition & Mastery** capability, replacing slow, haphazard learning with an efficient process for developing bioelectric expertise.
*   **2.8.4 Implementation Note:** Implementation requires decomposing complex skills into sub-skills, creating objective metrics for success, and establishing a consistent feedback loop (e.g., after-action reviews, coaching).
*   **2.8.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Marksmanship):** A sniper, instead of just shooting at a target, focuses exclusively on trigger control for an entire session. A coach provides immediate feedback on each shot, allowing for rapid, targeted improvement of that specific sub-skill.
    *   **Example 2 (Language Acquisition):** A linguist, instead of passively listening to a foreign language, engages in focused practice on a specific grammatical structure they find difficult. They receive immediate correction from a native speaker, repeat the exercise until proficient, and then move to the next sub-skill.
    *   **Example 3 (Medical Procedure):** A surgeon practices a specific suturing technique on a simulator that provides real-time feedback on precision and efficiency. The task is designed to be just beyond their current comfort level, pushing them to a higher level of proficiency.

### 2.9 Getting Things Done (GTD)
*   **2.9.1 Operational Definition:** The **GTD** subsystem functions as the operator's externalized task management architecture. Its purpose is to capture all commitments in a trusted, external system, thus offloading the cognitive burden of tracking open loops. This reduces systemic bioelectric "noise" and decoherence, freeing the network's computational resources.
*   **2.9.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Receives Inputs from OODA Loop:** The **Act** phase generates projects and next-actions that are immediately captured in the **GTD** system.
    *   **Outputs to Bio-System:** Manages the scheduling and execution of protocols for recharging the body's bioelectric potential.
    *   **Enables All Other Systems:** By creating a state of "mind like water," it frees up the bioelectric bandwidth required for high-level processes like **Systems Thinking** and **IFS**.
*   **2.9.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem delivers **Frictionless Task Management & Operational Clarity**. It provides a comprehensive inventory of all commitments, allowing for strategic allocation of attention and bioelectric resources.
*   **2.9.4 Implementation Note:** Full implementation requires unwavering adherence to the five stages: Capture, Clarify, Organize, Reflect, and Engage. A trusted, ubiquitous capture tool and a disciplined Weekly Review are the most critical components.
*   **2.9.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Capture):** During a meeting, an officer uses a digital notebook to capture every potential to-do, idea, or commitment that arises, without trying to organize or prioritize them in the moment. This ensures nothing is forgotten and their full attention remains on the meeting.
    *   **Example 2 (Clarify/Organize):** Later, the officer processes their inbox. An item like "Send report to HQ" is identified as a single action and moved to their "@Computer" list. An item like "Plan training exercise" is identified as a multi-step project, and a "Projects" list is updated with the desired outcome, while the very next action ("Email Major Smith to book the training area") is placed on their "@Email" list.
    *   **Example 3 (Weekly Review):** Every Friday afternoon, the officer conducts a Weekly Review, looking over all their project lists, calendars, and action lists. They ensure projects are on track, process any remaining open loops, and get a clear, strategic overview of the upcoming week, ensuring a clear and focused start on Monday.

### 2.10 Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
*   **2.10.1 Operational Definition:** The **NVC** subsystem is the standardized protocol for high-fidelity interpersonal engagement and influence. It is a structured language framework - based on **Observations, Feelings, Needs, and Requests** - designed to achieve interpersonal bioelectric co-regulation, shifting participants from defensive states toward a shared state of safety and connection (Ventral Vagal).
*   **2.10.2 System Interfaces and Data Exchange:**
    *   **Receives Inputs from OODA Loop:** It is the primary tool for executing the **Act** phase when that action involves communication.
    *   **Receives Inputs from IFS:** The communication is ideally delivered from the coherent bioelectric state of the **Self**, which can accurately identify the feelings and needs of its own "parts" before engaging externally.
    *   **Outputs to OODA Loop:** The response from the other person becomes a key piece of bioelectric intelligence for the next **Observe** phase in the ongoing interaction.
*   **2.10.3 Capability Contribution:** This subsystem provides the **High-Fidelity Communication & Influence** capability. It allows the operator to navigate complex social dynamics, de-escalate conflict, and build coalitions by consciously managing the shared bioelectric field of an interaction.
*   **2.10.4 Implementation Note:** Implementation requires practicing the specific four-part linguistic structure in both internal self-talk (for clarity) and external dialogue, moving from mechanical application to fluid proficiency.
*   **2.10.5 Implementation Examples:**
    *   **Example 1 (Giving Feedback):** Instead of saying "Your work is sloppy," a supervisor says: "**Observation:** When I saw the typos in the final brief, **Feeling:** I felt concerned **Need:** because I have a need for accuracy in our reports to leadership. **Request:** Would you be willing to walk me through your proofreading process?".
    *   **Example 2 (Receiving Criticism):** When told "You're always late," an operator translates the criticism into a potential unmet need, responding with: "Are you feeling frustrated because you need dependability from the team?" This de-escalates the situation and moves the conversation toward a solution.
    *   **Example 3 (Making a Request):** Instead of a vague demand like "Be more proactive," a team leader makes a clear, positive, and actionable request: "Would you be willing to draft a project proposal for the new initiative and have it on my desk by Friday?".
